# Text Adventure Game

## Introduction
- This project is aimed to create a complete bare-bone of a fully functional text-based adventure game.
- There will not be any story line except, skeleton structural engine of the game.
- A fully developed story-line game can implement in the future versions.

## Description
- Create a C++ text adventure with the storyline of your choosing. 
- The game should:
    - Use the knowledge of C++ `conditionals`, `logic`, and `loops`.
    - Use the knowledge of `Object Oriented programming`.
    - Use the `class`, `private`, `public`.
    - Be `documented` clearly into files.
