# Banking Record System C++ Project

- The idea here is to use the `file handling mechanism` in C++ to develop a simple console application. 
- In addition, this Banking Record System project is very close to being called a `database project` in C++.

# Features:

    - `read` file
    - `write` file
    - `edit` file
    - `search` in file
    - `delete` in file
    - `adjust records in files`

# Output:
